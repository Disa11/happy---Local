#### WEB50 Project4 - Happy Tails.

Web application using Python and JavaScript. This project has its backend implemented in Python Flask, working in conjunction with WebSocket.io for the client-side. The objective of this project is to develop a web application capable of connecting to an electronic device designed for monitoring the environment and food of a pet. Users can add their own machines or devices called "Happy," which consist of a camera with video streaming to observe their pet's activities throughout the day, humidity and temperature sensors to ensure the well-being of the pet, as well as a storage system and a programmed food dispenser for scheduled feeding times.



## View
In this project, a functional chat is required where messages can be viewed. Before that, the user needs to register to proceed and start chatting. In this case, I implemented a login and registration system for this section, which is displayed to any user making a GET request.
